# Notochthamalus

This is a repository I am using for code to assemble the transcriptome of Notochthamalus and aligning gDNA illumia reads to the transcriptome to look at a geographic cline.

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/karenbobier/Notochthamalus/wiki/_new) for info on what scripts were used for.
